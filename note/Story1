User Story #1
=============

This is an initial story for setting up the most rudimentary kaleidoverse:

* User browses to https://$name.github.io/kaleidoverse
  * $name starts with veradox, but can be any fork
  * $name is the "owner" of the kaleidoverse (ko)
* User sees a login screen
  * (Login via GitHub) button
* User clicks button
* User goes to login screen
  * Enter token (help explanation/link) to get token
  * Enter user login
  * System verifies these and logs in (stores in cookie)
* User is inside the ko (front page)
  * Maybe a 3d scenario of veradox ($name) assets
    * Avatar of $login user
  * An ominous fork is lying on the ground
* User picks up the fork and forks the ko
  * Or clicks a "fork the ko" link :)
  * Confirmation explains a bit and user clicks OK
  * System does fork and register to https://$user.github.io/kaleidoverse
    * Can take 10 minutes
    * User sees a spinner off to the side
  * User plays around with fun 3d stuff, while the setup happens
    * Good time for tutorials
* Fork is done and user teleports (clicks link) to their new kaleidoverse
