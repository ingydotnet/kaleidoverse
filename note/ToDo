+ git filter-branch out bogus commits
  + Used this command: (set -ex; for c in 3959d77 2c430f4 a2c2850 c55fe7e e884a44;do git filter-branch -f --commit-filter 'if [ "$GIT_COMMIT" = "'"$(git rev-parse $c)"'" ]; then skip_commit "$@"; else git commit-tree "$@"; fi'; done)
+ Fork and launch https://ingydotnet.github.io/kaleidoverse (from veradox)
x Figure out https
  x https://ingydotnet.github.io/kaleidoverse seems to just redirect to http://ingydotnet.github.io/kaleidoverse
